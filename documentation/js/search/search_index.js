The intention behind this project is to learn new techstack while trying to solve a real life probelm. You should be able to use git and employ various commands to commit.\nAngular\nAngular is a feature rich JS framework with various built-in capabilities like HTTP communication, routing, observables and dependency injection. It enhances productivity and reusability for development teams by eliminating the need to implement boilerplate code common to modern web apps.\nAngular is an opinionated framework, with loads of recommendations or prescriptions, this facilitates consistent application logic building with increased productivity.\nChronology\nInstall angular client version 8.1.2 and you are almost set. You can navigate to any folder of your choice or if required you can create one. I prefer to have my own folder and that way I can ensure what I am creating and where.\nThings you should know before you start contributing.\n\nAngular bootstrapping\nJavaScript and [Angular Modules]\nSome knowledge of CommonJS, AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)  - RequireJS, Webpack and Babel would be encouraging. ref-link\nIt is recommended to understand what is package.json and how to maintain it.\nLearn about the styleguide.\nAngular Lifecycle hooks.\nProperty binding\n\nApplication creation\nThe command (Angular CLI) used to create this application.\nng new --help\narguments:\n  name\n    The name of the new workspace and initial project.\n\noptions:\n  --collection (-c)\n    A collection of schematics to use in generating the initial app.\n  --commit\n    Initial git repository commit information.\n  --create-application\n    When true (the default), creates a new initial app project in the src folder of the new workspace. When false, creates an empty workspace with no initial app. You can then use the generate application command so that all apps are created in the projects folder.\n  --defaults\n    When true, disables interactive input prompts for options with a default.\n  --directory\n    The directory name to create the workspace in.\n  --dry-run (-d)\n    When true, runs through and reports activity without writing out results.\n  --enable-ivy\n    When true, creates a new app that uses the Ivy rendering engine.\n  --force (-f)\n    When true, forces overwriting of existing files.\n  --help\n    Shows a help message for this command in the console.\n  --inline-style (-s)\n    When true, includes styles inline in the component TS file. By default, an external styles file is created and referenced in the component TS file.\n  --inline-template (-t)\n    When true, includes template inline in the component TS file. By default, an external template file is created and referenced in the component TS file.\n  --interactive\n    When false, disables interactive input prompts.\n  --minimal\n    When true, creates a project without any testing frameworks. (Use for learning purposes only.)\n  --new-project-root\n    The path where new projects will be created, relative to the new workspace root.\n  --prefix (-p)\n    The prefix to apply to generated selectors for the initial project.\n  --routing\n    When true, generates a routing module for the initial project.\n  --skip-git (-g)\n    When true, does not initialize a git repository.\n  --skip-install\n    When true, does not install dependency packages.\n  --skip-tests (-S)\n    When true, does not generate \"spec.ts\" test files for the new project.\n  --style\n    The file extension or preprocessor to use for style files.\n  --verbose (-v)\n    When true, adds more details to output logging.\n  --view-encapsulation\n    The view encapsulation strategy to use in the initial project.  Pretty much delete everything in the app.component.html file and will start from there.\nRunning the development server - Application testing.\nYou can use ng serve for the dev server & navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild - Use --prod for production build.\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRun tests before any commit or push to the branch.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nGit - Tips\nAlways before you commit you should chceck the status\n  git statusIt will give an output like\ngit status\nOn branch v1.0\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/v1.0'.\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n        modified:   README.md\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)Add the files you wish to add before you push the commit\ngit add .followed by\ngit statuswhich should give an output like\ngit status\nOn branch v1.0\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/v1.0'.\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n\n        modified:   README.mdAlways provide comment to any changes that you shall commit.\ngit commit -m \"Added some basic components and guidelines\"What are we building & why\nThe expectation is to start with a simple SPA that will employ Angular and some cascading style sheet framework that can either be Bootstrap or Angular Material and shall have a Navigation bar at the top. The basic topics that it should cover are\n\nIntroduction/Mission statement\nAbout (The stakeholders)\nHighlights (May be link to the individual blogs)\n\nWhy choose Angular\nThe basic question that everyone asks is why you went ahead with that specific choice of framework, when the others had similar or slightly better offerring? We had a similar dilemma and we chose Angular because of the following reasons\n\nResources available.\nExisting expertise.\nTime at hand.\n\nGuidelines\nBasic guidelines to be followed\n\nNo component code to be checked in without the unit testing code (spec). helper link\n\nUnderstand ComponentFixture which gives us a reference to the component instance being tested, as well as the component’s template.\nDo understand the TestBed utility, which is responsible for initializing the environment.\nDo go through the Angular Testing.\nUndestand the Jasmine Syntax.\nUnderstand Behavior driven development.\nTools that we shall use for testing will be as provided by the Angular CLI\nKarma - The test runner.\nJasmine - The basic syntax.\nYou can explore the other options like Sinon and Wallaby, Cypress etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeforeEach(async(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      declarations: [ PersonComponent ]\n    })\n    .compileComponents();\n  }\nAngular style guideline to be employed, use lint before every commit.\nE2E to be decided.\n\nGood links to read\n\nJasmine how to spy\nProgressive web app & Service worker intro\nCan I use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
